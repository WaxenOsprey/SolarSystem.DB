## Project Brief

### SolarSystem.DB

Build an app that allows a user to explore and catalogue the solar system.

### MVP

- The app should allow the user to create (discover) new moons and planets and edit their properties
- The app should allow the user to travel from the sun to each planet/moon and view information about the planet
- The app should allow the user to destroy any solar system object.

### Possible Extensions

- The app should allow the user to see a summary of their activities at the end of their visit
- Show distance to sun at each solar system object
- The app could have the capabilities to discover, edit, and destroy other objects in solar system e.g. asteroids/comets.
